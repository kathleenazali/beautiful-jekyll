I'm currently based in Singapore as a Research Associate at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS). As a researcher and a practicing designer-developer, I am interested in the histories and intersections of information, (digital) technology, design, and society.

Some of my works on these topics have been presented/published in [Networked Researcher Open Access](http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/8419/) (City University of London, 2012), [Cornell University Southeast Asia Bulletin](https://seap.einaudi.cornell.edu/publication/2014-spring-e-bulletin) (2014), SOJOURN (2015, 2016), [Oxford University](http://projectsoutheastasia.com/) (2016), University of Technology Sydney's [PORTAL Journal of Multidisciplinary International Studies](http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/journals/index.php/portal/article/view/5024/5495) (2016), [Journal of Southeast Asian Economies](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/647394) (2016), [Free & Open Source Software Asia Summit](http://2017.fossasia.org/) (FOSSASIA 2017), and [the Australian National University's annual Indonesia Update on Digital Indonesia](http://www.newmandala.org/digital-indonesia/) (2017). More details in my CV.

I juggle many hats, but one that I most often wear is as the founder of [C2O library & collabtive](https://c2o-library.net), an independent library and coworking community space in Surabaya, Indonesia, established in 2008. I hold a Master in Cultural Studies from Airlangga University, with a thesis on alternative librariesâ€”-awarded 2013 Graduate Research Fellowship support from the [Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore](https://ari.nus.edu.sg/).
