## Disclosure Statement

First thing first, this is a personal website. **The views expressed on this site are solely my own, and do not represent/reflect my employer(s), institution(s), or anyone else with whom I may be remotely affiliated**. While I founded [C2O library &amp; collabtive](https://c2o-library.net), within this site, I am not speaking on behalf of the organisation, and what I say may not reflect the beliefs or interests of C2O—or any individual or organisation that I'm affiliated with. I say what I want and no one pays me to write this blog or say particular things in it. I am not compensated for my blog – I do not run ads, no one pays me under the table, and I don’t sell you t-shirts or coffee mugs or tote bags of any kind. I do get compensated to write in other places, but not here; I sometimes repost content that I write for elsewhere here because I think it might be of interest (and then I identify where it was originally posted), but I do not repost everything. I don’t do favors or write about people because they’re nice to me; I may write about other people when I think their work is interesting or when I’m working with them but I also might not.

## Affiliations

- Since late 2013, I have been working full-time as a Research Associate at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS), Singapore. 
- Previously, I was a 2013 Graduate Research Fellow at Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore. 
- I'm the founder and director of C2O library &amp; collabtive, an independent library and coworking community space established in 2008 in Surabaya, Indonesia.

## Conferences, workshops, talks

I attend conferences, festivals and workshops, and regard them as important channels for information exchange and to meet people, but it also means spending a significant time, energy, thoughts, and money. I usually only attend when I present a paper, or am involved in the event organising. I don’t generally go to conference that charge admission fees unless I’m invited as speaker, and for out-of-town or overseas engagement, I usually rely on travel grants.

That said, I am willing to speak for free or pay my own travel &amp; accommodation fees at not-for-profit conferences and other events whose cause I believe in, or those put together by my friends. I do my best to make room for actions that I think can make a difference, and am known for not being fussy about comfort. However, there are times when my means and time are limited, so please understand and don’t take it personally if I have to say no.
